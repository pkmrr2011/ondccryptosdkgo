## Contribution process

### Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use [GitHub pull requests](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests)
for this purpose.

## Testing

We use `bazel` to test our services. You can test all services by running this command.
`bazel test //... --test_output=errors --define DOCKER_REGISTRY="" --define DOCKER_REPOSITORY=""`

you can perform the test on a specific target by running `bazel test //<PATH_TO_BUILD_FILE>:<TARGET>`.
For example,
```
bazel test //buyer-platform/bap-api:all
```

### Note

Some tests require a Spanner Emulator running on your local machine. To start Spanner Emulator locally, see [Emulate Cloud Spanner locally](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/emulator).

By default, our test functions communicate with Spanner Emulator on port `9010` via `gRPC` protocol. If you specify a custom port when running Spanner Emulator, you need to set `SPANNER_EMULATOR_ADDRESS` test environment vari	able to that address when running `blaze test`.
For example,
`bazel test --test_env=SPANNER_EMULATOR_ADDRESS=localhost:9010 //â€¦`
